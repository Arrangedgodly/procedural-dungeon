To create the effect of a shockwave emanating from the Necromancer's staff, it's important to separate the impact effect from the character itself. Place the effect on a layer beneath the characters. Activate the effect on frame 11 of the Necromancer's animation, ensuring the center of the oval (shockwave) is aligned directly below the base of the staff. This will give the impression that the shockwave is originating from the correct point, creating a more realistic visual impact.
